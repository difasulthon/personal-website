        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have about 4 years of experience in developing and maintaining mobile applications using React Native. I have a strong fundamental in Javascript/TypeScript programming language. Based on these experiences and skills, I was able to contribute to working on a web app with ReactJS and working on the back end with NodeJS. I have experience working on application development with clean code, unit testing, and type checking to write readable and maintainable code. I have the ability to work with agile methods and communicate well with team members such as Back End Developer, QA/Tester, Product Owner, or other stakeholders to achieve goals and deliver the best software product.</p>
